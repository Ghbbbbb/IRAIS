# Intelligent Robotic Arm Interaction Scheme
This is the code repository for the competition of **《ABB杯智能技术创新大赛--机智融合——当机器人遇上可移动设备》**. Our project is named **An Intelligent Robotic Arm Interaction Scheme(IRAIS) Based on Large Language Models**.  

To address the issue of low success rates in code execution generated by Large Language Models, we adopted a multi-agent collaboration approach. By enhancing prompt learning and skill library retrieval updates, we significantly improved the success rate and robustness of the model on downstream tasks. Additionally, we integrated mobile devices to offer an embodied intelligence solution, enabling real-time, remote voice interaction through a mobile app, featuring chat, embodiment, and remote functionality.

## Install
Install requirements for repository 
```
    # Install robopal emulation environment
    cd robopal
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Install the main program dependencies
    cd ..
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run

- gpt
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY = [YOUR_KEY]
python server_abb.py [--write *** --doc --voice]
python client_retrieval_gpt_abb.py [--debug --doc --voice --prompt ***]
```

The prediction file will be dumped in the output/ folder if `--write ***` has been store.

## Evaluation

```
cd output
python compare.py --file "gpt3.5_dcpd1-1-base.txt"
python compare.py --file "gpt3.5_dcpd1-1-ours.txt"
....
```

## results
gpt3.5-turbo-0613
- Output: output/gpt3.5-dcpd1-1-base.txt
- Accuracy: 70%
- Mean error: 0.151  
- Output: outputs/gpt3.5-dcpd1-1-ours.json
- Accuracy: 95%
- Mean error: 0.026


## note
At present, the code and datasets are still being updated. We plan to make the code publicly available in future work once the project reaches completion. For now, we are sharing this preliminary version for review purposes only. We kindly ask for your understanding and respect for the intellectual property involved.
